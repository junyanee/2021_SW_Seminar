void * bsearch ( const void * key, const void * base, size_t num, size_t size, int ( * comparator ) ( const void *, const void * ) );Binary search in array
Searches the given key in the array pointed by base that is formed by num elements, each of a size of size bytes, and returns a void* pointer to the first entry in the table that matches the search key.

To perform the search, the function compares the elements to the key by calling the function comparator specified as the last argument.

Because this function performs a binary search, the values in the base array are expected to be already sorted in ascending order, with the same criteria used by comparator.
